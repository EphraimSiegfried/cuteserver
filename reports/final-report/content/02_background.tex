\section*{Background}
In this section we explain some concepts we had to understand implementing our project. 
% Some "prerequisite" knowledge we assume is known: Socket Programming Protocols (TCP etc.), Interprocess Communication 
% Fussnote: HTTP Protocol Doc, CGI doc  

\subsection*{HTTP Protocol}
% historical (0.9 to 1.1). 
% Request types   
% structure (headers, message etc)
% headers (keep-alive)

\subsection*{CGI}
% why does it need cgi ? -> POST requests, backend services
% picture: 
% common gateway interface
% different types of implementation: fastCGI is the standard today
