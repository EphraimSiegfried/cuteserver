\subsection*{Inspirations}

We used the following web server implementations as inspirations for our own web server. Initially, we copied some code snippets from these sources, but over time, we refactored and significantly modified these code parts.

\subsection*{Use of AI}
We primarily used ChatGPT for the example application part of our project. It wrote some functions and translated python Flask code to C code. However, we always had to modify much of the generated output.
