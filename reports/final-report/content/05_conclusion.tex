\section*{Conclusion}
% Comparison to original Plan 
In Comparison to our initial project plan, our webserver fulfilled the following requirements: process HTTP requests, allow multiple clients to connect, handle concurrent access to resources, handle errors, log web traffic, handle multiple domains and resources. We implemented everything but websockets. Overall, we are satisfied with our result.


\subsection*{Lessons learned}
\begin{description}
    \item[Project Plan]We rarely looked at the JIRA Project Plan we created in the beginning.Maybe next time we can find a more appropriate planning tool for our workflow.
    Where we spent more time as initially planned was the POST-Request handling, as we didn't know about CGI (Common Gateway Interface) before, and had to spend more time than anticipated understanding and implementing the protocol. 
    \item[Testing] We only started performance testing our application in the end. Some of the results were quite confusing. To test multithreading we had to consider different system behaviour in Docker, test on different machines because Locust also needs resources, ...
    \item[System Influences]We had some difficulties in getting our application to run the same way on different machines. Outside influences such as hardware, network configuration on our servers etc. lead to some errors. 
    \item[Memory Management] Buffer Sizes ...

\subsection*{Future Outlook}
\begin{description}
    \item[fast CGI]Implementing fast CGI to enhance performance and keep up with standards
    \item[Security]Test and enhance the security of our webserver
    \item[Websockets]
