\section*{Conclusion}
% Comparison to original Plan 
We were successful in our project and comparing to our original plan we implemented everything but websockets. 
What we miscalculated a bit was the POST-Request handling (as we didn't know about CGI before). This took more time than we anticipated. 

Project Planning in General: we never looked at the JIRA Board during the project. so maybe next time find a different way to plan.

\subsection*{Lessons learned}
% handling strings in C 
% if statements  
% dont close sockets and then forget 

\subsection*{Future Outlook}
% fast CGI 
% Security 
% Websockets
