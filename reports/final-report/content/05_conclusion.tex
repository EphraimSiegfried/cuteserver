\section*{Conclusion}
% Comparison to original Plan 
In Comparison to our initial project plan, our webserver fulfilled the following requirements: process HTTP requests, allow multiple clients to connect, handle concurrent access to resources, handle errors, log web traffic, handle multiple domains and resources. We implemented everything but websockets. \\

We are satisfied with our result and had fun and learned a lot. Regarding the project planning, we never looked at the JIRA Board during the whole project. Maybe next time we can find a more appropriate planning tool for our workflow. \\

Where we spent more time as initially planned was the POST-Request handling, as we didn't know about CGI (Common Gateway Interface) before, and had to spend more time than anticipated understanding and implementing the protocol. 

\subsection*{Lessons learned}
\begin{itemize}
    \item handling Strings in C 
    \item memory management (buffer sizes)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Future Outlook}
\begin{description}
    \item[fast CGI]Implementing fast CGI to enhance performance and keep up with standards
    \item[Security]Test and enhance the security of our webserver
    \item[Websockets]
\end{description}
